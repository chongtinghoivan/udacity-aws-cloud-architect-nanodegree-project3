# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Web application firewalls (WAF) can be set up to block or log suspicious traffic.
WAFs are designed to sit between a client and an application to inspect application HTTP traffic and determine if the traffic patterns signify exploitation attempts. 


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, as the default policy of gateway endpoint allows access by any user or service within the VPC to any Amazon S3 resource.


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the bucket. After you enable default encryption, the encryption that you set applies only to future uploads. 


# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All the configuration we made directly through the AWS management console to the original cloudformation configuration would be reset.

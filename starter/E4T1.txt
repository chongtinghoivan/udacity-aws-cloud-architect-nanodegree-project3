# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Disable SSH password login on the application server instance
2. Update the security group which is assigned to the web application instance. Only allow connections to port 5000 from the public subnet where the application load balancer resides.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

1. Implement least privilege access
Currently the IAM Role c3-app-InstanceRole has a permission policy "InstanceRolePolicy-C3" attached, which grants the role full access to all resources of S3. The policy should be edited by limiting the access to only the free recipes bucket.

2. Apply Default Server-side Encryption to the S3 Bucket
Server-side encryption could be enabled on the secret recipes bucket. 
Amazon S3 default encryption provides a way to set the default encryption behaviour for an S3 bucket. We can set default encryption on a bucket so that all new objects are encrypted when they are stored in the bucket. The objects are encrypted using server-side encryption with either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
